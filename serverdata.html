      <p>JackBlack Rules

Goal: Get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Beat the dealer to win.

Card Values:

2–10 = face value

J, Q, K = 10

A = 11 or 1

Gameplay:

Each player gets 2 cards; dealer gets 2 cards.

On your turn, choose:

Hit → draw a card

Stand → keep your hand

If your score > 21 → Busted

If your score = 21 → automatic stand

Dealer Turn: Dealer draws until reaching 17 or higher.

Winning:

Highest score ≤ 21 wins.

If all players bust → dealer wins.

Blackjack (21 on first 2 cards) wins instantly.
